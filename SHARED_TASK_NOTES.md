# Shared Task Notes

## Current Goal
Improve sentences in README.md (one per iteration)

## This Iteration
- Improved line 3: Project description sentence
- Made it more concise and impactful by removing redundant words
- Before: "An automated workflow that runs Claude Code in a continuous loop, creating and merging pull requests until your development goal is complete."
- After: "Automated workflow running Claude Code continuously—creating, reviewing, and merging PRs until your development goal is complete."
- Key changes: Removed "that runs" filler, changed "pull requests" to "PRs", added "reviewing" to clarify the workflow includes PR checks

## Next Iteration
Pick another sentence in README.md to improve. Consider:
- Examples section (lines 44-54): Comment descriptions could be more specific about what each example demonstrates
- Line 7: "For tasks that require multiple iterations to complete, this script runs Claude Code repeatedly until done" - could be more concise
- Lines 34-39: Flag descriptions could include more context about when/why to use each option
