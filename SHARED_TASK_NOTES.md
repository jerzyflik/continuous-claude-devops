# Shared Task Notes

## Current Goal
Improve sentences in README.md (one per iteration)

## This Iteration
- Improved line 3: Main description of what the tool does
- Before: "Automated workflow running Claude Code continuously - creating, reviewing, and merging PRs until your development goal is complete."
- After: "Automated workflow that orchestrates Claude Code in a continuous loop, autonomously creating PRs, waiting for checks, and merging—so multi-step projects complete while you sleep."
- Key change: Added concrete benefit ("complete while you sleep") and stronger action verb ("orchestrates")

## Next Iteration
Pick another sentence in README.md to improve. Consider:
- Examples section (lines 44-54): Comment descriptions could be more specific about what each example demonstrates
- Lines 34-39: Flag descriptions could include more context about when/why to use each option
- Line 7: "This script runs Claude Code in iterations..." could be more specific about the value
