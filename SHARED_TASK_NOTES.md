# Shared Task Notes

## Current Goal
Improve sentences in README.md (one per iteration)

## This Iteration
- Improved line 7: "How it works" section intro sentence
- Made it more concise by removing redundant phrasing
- Before: "For tasks that require multiple iterations to complete, this script runs Claude Code repeatedly until done:"
- After: "This script runs Claude Code in iterations until multi-step tasks are complete:"
- Key changes: Removed wordy "For tasks that require" opening, changed "repeatedly until done" to clearer "in iterations", flipped structure to put action first

## Next Iteration
Pick another sentence in README.md to improve. Consider:
- Examples section (lines 44-54): Comment descriptions could be more specific about what each example demonstrates
- Lines 34-39: Flag descriptions could include more context about when/why to use each option
- Line 15: "A `SHARED_TASK_NOTES.md` file coordinates work across iterations between humans and AI" - could emphasize the relay-race nature
