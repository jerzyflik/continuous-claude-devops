# Shared Task Notes

## Current Goal
Improve sentences in README.md (one per iteration)

## This Iteration
- Improved line 19: Quick start prerequisites sentence
- Made it more specific and actionable with direct links
- Before: "Make sure you have Claude Code CLI and GitHub CLI installed and authenticated."
- After: "Prerequisites: Install and authenticate the [Claude Code CLI](https://code.claude.com) and [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com)."

## Next Iteration
Pick another sentence in README.md to improve. Consider:
- Examples section (lines 44-54): Comment descriptions could be more specific
- Line 3: Project description could be more concise
- Lines 34-39: Flags descriptions could be more actionable
