# Shared Task Notes

## Current Goal
Improve sentences in README.md (one per iteration)

## This Iteration
- Improved line 19: Quick start prerequisites sentence
- Made it more structured and specific about both tools needed
- Before: "Make sure you have Claude Code CLI and GitHub CLI installed and authenticated. Then:"
- After: "Prerequisites: Install and authenticate both the Claude Code CLI and GitHub CLI (`gh`). Then:"

## Next Iteration
Pick another sentence in README.md to improve. Consider:
- Examples section (lines 44-54): Comment descriptions could be more specific
- Line 3: Project description could be more concise
- Flags section (lines 34-39): Descriptions could be more actionable
